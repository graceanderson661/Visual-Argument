This is a combination of my visual argument intro and narrative reflection. 

This project is a visual argument of drug use by young people. It can be over-normalized as harmless in some spaces, and people can get lost in the reality of their actions. Anti-drug campaigns tend to distance everyday people and drug addicts when, in fact, it is everywhere. I thought of making it seem like someone was talking to the girl in the picture to try the drug, and then the words started to be in first person, symbolizing her thoughts. The images and words on the left depict it as fun, and on the right are the negative effects. The rhetoric of this project is to allow the audience to see that it can happen to you and that you might not look like a stereotypical drug addict. 

The design choices that I made changed a lot from my initial design and the final draft. I wanted to use less words and to use a shocking picture of elementary aged kids eating lunch with the drug paraphernalia on the table. It is to make the audience understand that just like the children around drugs is dangerous and shocking is the same as when it is around older people. The purpose of the argument is to spread awareness that drug use is not normal or fun. I wanted the picture to be very clear of what was on the table, so I made the images large and in the center. I used proximity within the images and the children to allow the audience to link the two images together. I also wanted the pictures to be realistic so it created more of a shocking story. I initially did not want any words to be on the poster but for the audience to have a better understanding of the message I added a title. This change came from the feedback from my peer reviews because they thought it would become more powerful with a clear message.

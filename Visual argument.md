This project is a visual argument of drug use by young people. It can be over-normalized as harmless in some spaces and people can get lost from the reality of what they are doing. Anti drug campaigns tend to distance everyday people and drug addicts when in reality it is everywhere. I thought of making it seem like someone was talking to the girl in the picture to try the drug and then the words started to be in first person symbolizing her own thoughts. The pictures and words on the left are depicting it being fun and on the right are the negative effects. The rhetoric of this project is to allow the audience to see that it can happen to you and that you might not look like a stereotypical drug addict.
